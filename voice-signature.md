# Voice Signature Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding voice signature capabilities to Documenso. The feature will allow users to sign documents using their voice, creating a more secure and accessible signing method that provides stronger authentication and an improved audit trail.

## Feature Requirements

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Record voice signatures during document signing
- ✅ Store voice recordings securely with documents
- ⬜ Allow playback of voice signatures when reviewing documents
- ✅ Implement voice-to-text transcription for verification
- ⬜ Add voice pattern analysis for signature verification
- ⬜ Support voice enrollment for recurring signers

### User Experience
- ✅ Intuitive voice recording interface
- ✅ Clear instructions for voice signature collection
- ✅ Visual representation of voice patterns (waveform)
- ⬜ Accessibility accommodations for users who cannot use voice
- ✅ Transparent consent for voice data collection

## Technical Architecture

### Integration Points

The voice signature feature has been integrated with the existing codebase at these key points:

1. **Database Layer**
   - ✅ `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`: Extended signature schema with voice fields
   
2. **Core Signing Logic**
   - ✅ `packages/lib/server-only/field/sign-field-with-token.ts`: Updated to handle voice signatures
   - ✅ Fixed metadata transmission between client and server components
   - ✅ Added robust error handling for JSON metadata parsing

3. **UI Components**
   - ✅ `packages/ui/primitives/voice-signature/voice-signature-pad.tsx`: Created voice recording component
   - ✅ Enhanced transcript handling with fallback mechanisms
   
4. **Signing Flow**
   - ✅ `apps/web/src/app/(signing)/sign/[token]/voice-signature-field.tsx`: Implemented voice signature field
   - ✅ Improved error handling and added safety checks for missing/invalid metadata
   
5. **Transcription API**
   - ✅ `apps/web/src/app/api/voice-transcription/route.ts`: Added API endpoint for voice transcription using OpenAI Whisper

6. **tRPC Integration**
   - ✅ `packages/trpc/server/field-router/router.ts`: Fixed metadata parameter passing in the tRPC layer
   - ✅ Added detailed logging for troubleshooting

### Storage Architecture

We've implemented a simplified storage approach:

1. **Voice Signatures**:
   - ✅ Audio files stored as base64 strings in the database (`voiceSignatureUrl` field)
   - ✅ Recording timestamp stored in `voiceSignatureCreatedAt`
   - ✅ Transcription stored in `voiceSignatureTranscript` field
   - ✅ Additional metadata stored in `voiceSignatureMetadata` field
   - ✅ Fixed metadata transmission to ensure proper storage in the database

## Verification Strategy

We've implemented a dual verification approach that significantly enhances security:

1. **Content Verification** (✅ Implemented):
   - ✅ Transcribe the voice recording to text using OpenAI Whisper API
   - ✅ Store the transcript in the `voiceSignatureTranscript` field
   - ⬜ Verify that the content matches the expected script or declaration
   - ✅ Display transcript during signing for user verification
   - ✅ Added robust error handling for transcript processing

2. **Speaker Verification** (⬜ Planned):
   - ⬜ Compare voice biometrics against enrolled voice patterns
   - ⬜ Verify the identity of the signer based on voice characteristics
   - ⬜ More secure than traditional signature methods
   - ⬜ Requires enrollment process and voice pattern storage

This approach provides two layers of security: verifying what was said and who said it.

  // Voice signature fields (implemented)
  voiceSignatureUrl          String?
  voiceSignatureTranscript   String?
  voiceSignatureMetadata     Json?
  voiceSignatureCreatedAt    DateTime?
}

// New model for voice enrollment (planned for future phase)
model VoiceEnrollment {
  id                String    @id @default(cuid())
  userId            Int
  createdAt         DateTime  @default(now())
  lastUsedAt        DateTime?
  voicePatternData  Bytes     @db.ByteA
  isActive          Boolean   @default(true)
  
  user              User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

## Next Immediate Steps

   - Create database schema for voice pattern storage
   - Implement basic voice enrollment component

## Verification Process

To verify that voice signatures are properly saved to the database, you can:

1. **Query the database directly**:
   ```typescript
   const voiceSignatures = await prisma.signature.findMany({
     where: {
       voiceSignatureUrl: {
         not: null
       }
     },
     select: {
       id: true,
       fieldId: true,
       recipientId: true,
       voiceSignatureCreatedAt: true,
       voiceSignatureTranscript: true,
       voiceSignatureMetadata: true
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Check document audit logs**:
   ```typescript
   const voiceSignatureAuditLogs = await prisma.documentAuditLog.findMany({
     where: {
       type: 'DOCUMENT_FIELD_INSERTED',
       data: {
         path: ['field', 'type'],
         equals: 'VOICE_SIGNATURE'
       }
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Review server logs** (New):
   The enhanced logging we've added provides detailed information about:
   - Metadata receipt and processing on the server
   - Transcript extraction from metadata
   - JSON parsing success or failures
   - Final storage of voice signature data

## Looking Forward

With the foundation for voice signatures now complete and reliability issues addressed, the next phase will focus on:

1. Enhancing the user experience with voice playback in the document viewer
2. Implementing speaker verification with voice enrollment
3. Adding content verification against expected phrases
4. Ensuring voice signatures are properly secured and authenticated

The dual verification approach (content + speaker) will position Documenso's voice signature feature as a highly secure and reliable method for document signing.
