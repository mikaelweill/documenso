# Voice Signature Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding voice signature capabilities to Documenso. The feature will allow users to sign documents using their voice, creating a more secure and accessible signing method that provides stronger authentication and an improved audit trail.

## Feature Requirements

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Record voice signatures during document signing
- ✅ Store voice recordings securely with documents
- ⬜ Allow playback of voice signatures when reviewing documents
- ✅ Implement voice-to-text transcription for verification
- ⬜ Add voice pattern analysis for signature verification
- ⬜ Support voice enrollment for recurring signers

### User Experience
- ✅ Intuitive voice recording interface
- ✅ Clear instructions for voice signature collection
- ✅ Visual representation of voice patterns (waveform)
- ⬜ Accessibility accommodations for users who cannot use voice
- ✅ Transparent consent for voice data collection

## Technical Architecture

### Integration Points

The voice signature feature has been integrated with the existing codebase at these key points:

1. **Database Layer**
   - ✅ `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`: Extended signature schema with voice fields
   
2. **Core Signing Logic**
   - ✅ `packages/lib/server-only/field/sign-field-with-token.ts`: Updated to handle voice signatures

3. **UI Components**
   - ✅ `packages/ui/primitives/voice-signature/voice-signature-pad.tsx`: Created voice recording component
   
4. **Signing Flow**
   - ✅ `apps/web/src/app/(signing)/sign/[token]/voice-signature-field.tsx`: Implemented voice signature field

5. **Transcription API**
   - ✅ `apps/web/src/app/api/voice-transcription/route.ts`: Added API endpoint for voice transcription using OpenAI Whisper

### Storage Architecture

We've implemented a simplified storage approach:

1. **Voice Signatures**:
   - ✅ Audio files stored as base64 strings in the database (`voiceSignatureUrl` field)
   - ✅ Recording timestamp stored in `voiceSignatureCreatedAt`
   - ✅ Transcription stored in `voiceSignatureTranscript` field
   - ✅ Additional metadata stored in `voiceSignatureMetadata` field

## Verification Strategy

We've implemented a dual verification approach that significantly enhances security:

1. **Content Verification** (✅ Implemented):
   - ✅ Transcribe the voice recording to text using OpenAI Whisper API
   - ✅ Store the transcript in the `voiceSignatureTranscript` field
   - ⬜ Verify that the content matches the expected script or declaration
   - ✅ Display transcript during signing for user verification

2. **Speaker Verification** (⬜ Planned):
   - ⬜ Compare voice biometrics against enrolled voice patterns
   - ⬜ Verify the identity of the signer based on voice characteristics
   - ⬜ More secure than traditional signature methods
   - ⬜ Requires enrollment process and voice pattern storage

This approach provides two layers of security: verifying what was said and who said it.

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (⬜ Next Steps)

1. **Document Viewing & Playback**
   - ⬜ Create component to play back voice signatures when viewing documents
   - ⬜ Add visual indicator for voice signatures in document preview
   - ⬜ Display transcript alongside audio playback

2. **Voice Biometrics** (Speaker Verification)
   - ⬜ Implement voice enrollment process for recurring signers
   - ⬜ Create voice pattern analysis and storage
   - ⬜ Add voice matching to verify signer identity
   - ⬜ Store verification results in signature metadata

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - ⬜ Implement secure storage for voice data
   - ⬜ Add encryption for voice signatures
   - ⬜ Handle secure transport of audio data

4. **PDF Integration**
   - ⬜ Update PDF generation to include voice signature metadata
   - ⬜ Add QR codes or links to access voice recordings

## Current Working State

The voice signature feature is now operational with the following capabilities:

1. **Recording**: Users can record their voice as a signature using the VoiceSignaturePad component
2. **Storage**: Voice recordings are saved to the database as base64 strings
3. **Transcription**: Recordings are automatically transcribed using OpenAI Whisper API
4. **UI**: The signing interface shows a clear indicator when a voice has been recorded, along with the transcript
5. **Metadata**: Duration and transcript information are stored for each voice signature

## Database Schema Implementation

```prisma
model Signature {
  // Existing fields...
  
  // Voice signature fields (implemented)
  voiceSignatureUrl          String?
  voiceSignatureTranscript   String?
  voiceSignatureMetadata     Json?
  voiceSignatureCreatedAt    DateTime?
}

// New model for voice enrollment (planned for future phase)
model VoiceEnrollment {
  id                String    @id @default(cuid())
  userId            Int
  createdAt         DateTime  @default(now())
  lastUsedAt        DateTime?
  voicePatternData  Bytes     @db.ByteA
  isActive          Boolean   @default(true)
  
  user              User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Voice Signature Playback**:
   - Create a component to play back voice signatures when viewing signed documents
   - Add visual indicators in the document viewer for fields with voice signatures
   - Implement secure access controls for voice playback

2. **Content Verification Improvements**:
   - Add configurable expected phrases/scripts for verification
   - Implement comparison between transcript and expected content
   - Add UI feedback based on transcript verification results

3. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Add visual indicator of recording quality
   - Improve error handling for microphone permission issues
   - Add fallback options when voice recording fails

4. **Enrollment Framework** (Phase 2 Preparation):
   - Design the enrollment flow for recurring signers
   - Create database schema for voice pattern storage
   - Implement basic voice enrollment component

## Verification Process

To verify that voice signatures are properly saved to the database, you can:

1. **Query the database directly**:
   ```typescript
   const voiceSignatures = await prisma.signature.findMany({
     where: {
       voiceSignatureUrl: {
         not: null
       }
     },
     select: {
       id: true,
       fieldId: true,
       recipientId: true,
       voiceSignatureCreatedAt: true,
       voiceSignatureTranscript: true,
       voiceSignatureMetadata: true
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Check document audit logs**:
   ```typescript
   const voiceSignatureAuditLogs = await prisma.documentAuditLog.findMany({
     where: {
       type: 'DOCUMENT_FIELD_INSERTED',
       data: {
         path: ['field', 'type'],
         equals: 'VOICE_SIGNATURE'
       }
     }
   });
   ```

## Looking Forward

With the foundation for voice signatures now complete, including transcription functionality, the next phase will focus on:

1. Enhancing the user experience with voice playback in the document viewer
2. Implementing speaker verification with voice enrollment
3. Adding content verification against expected phrases
4. Ensuring voice signatures are properly secured and authenticated

The dual verification approach (content + speaker) will position Documenso's voice signature feature as a highly secure and reliable method for document signing.
