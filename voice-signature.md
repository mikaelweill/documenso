# Voice Signature Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding voice signature capabilities to Documenso. The feature will allow users to sign documents using their voice, creating a more secure and accessible signing method that provides stronger authentication and an improved audit trail.

## Feature Requirements

### Core Functionality
- Record voice signatures during document signing
- Store voice recordings securely with documents
- Allow playback of voice signatures when reviewing documents
- Implement voice-to-text transcription for verification
- Add voice pattern analysis for signature verification
- Support voice enrollment for recurring signers

### User Experience
- Intuitive voice recording interface
- Clear instructions for voice signature collection
- Visual representation of voice patterns (waveform)
- Accessibility accommodations for users who cannot use voice
- Transparent consent for voice data collection

## Technical Architecture

### Integration Points

The voice signature feature will integrate with the existing codebase at these key points:

1. **Database Layer**
   - `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`: Extend signature schema
   
2. **Core Signing Logic**
   - `packages/signing/`: Add voice signature transport

3. **UI Components**
   - `packages/ui/primitives/`: Create voice recording components
   
4. **Signing Flow**
   - `apps/web/src/app/(signing)/sign/[token]/`: Extend signature field

### Storage Architecture

We'll implement a hybrid storage approach:

1. **Enrollment Videos** (one-time identity verification):
   - Stored on local disk in development (`local-storage/enrollment-videos/`)
   - Used only for initial identity verification
   - Extracted audio patterns stored in database for future verification
   - In production, would use S3 buckets

2. **Voice Signatures** (regular signing):
   - Smaller audio files stored directly in database
   - More efficient for frequent access during document operations
   - Simpler development workflow
   - In production, could be migrated to S3 based on performance needs

This approach optimizes for development simplicity while maintaining a clear separation between one-time enrollment and regular signing operations.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

## Data Models

### Database Schema Changes

```prisma
model Signature {
  // Existing fields...
  
  // Voice signature fields
  voiceSignatureUrl          String?
  voiceSignatureTranscript   String?
  voiceSignatureMetadata     Json?
  voiceSignatureCreatedAt    DateTime?
  voiceEnrollmentId          String?   @unique
  
  // Verification fields
  voiceVerificationStatus    String?
  voiceVerificationScore     Float?
  voiceVerificationDetails   Json?
}

// New model for voice enrollment (optional)
model VoiceEnrollment {
  id                String    @id @default(cuid())
  userId            Int
  createdAt         DateTime  @default(now())
  lastUsedAt        DateTime?
  voicePatternData  Bytes     @db.ByteA
  isActive          Boolean   @default(true)
  
  // Reference to enrollment video (for development)
  enrollmentVideoPath String?
  
  user              User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  signatures        Signature[]
}
```

## Component Specifications

### VoiceSignaturePad Component

A new React component for recording and displaying voice signatures:

```tsx
// Location: packages/ui/primitives/voice-signature/voice-signature-pad.tsx

type VoiceSignaturePadProps = {
  onChange: (voiceData: VoiceSignatureData | null) => void;
  onValidityChange: (isValid: boolean) => void;
  defaultValue?: VoiceSignatureData;
  disabled?: boolean;
  promptText?: string;
  isEnrollment?: boolean; // Whether this is for enrollment (video) or regular signing (audio)
};

type VoiceSignatureData = {
  audioBlob: Blob;
  audioUrl: string;
  videoBlob?: Blob; // Only used for enrollment
  transcript?: string;
  duration: number;
  waveformData: number[];
};
```

### Signature Field Extension

Extend the existing signature field to support voice signatures:

```tsx
// Location: apps/web/src/app/(signing)/sign/[token]/signature-field.tsx

// Add to SignatureFieldState type
type SignatureFieldState = 'empty' | 'signed-image' | 'signed-text' | 'signed-voice';

// Add to the component rendering logic
if (state === 'signed-voice') {
  return (
    <VoiceSignatureDisplay 
      audioUrl={signature?.voiceSignatureUrl}
      transcript={signature?.voiceSignatureTranscript}
    />
  );
}
```

## User Flows

### Voice Signature Enrollment
1. User sets up profile in Documenso
2. Option to enroll voice for easier future signing
3. User records verification phrase(s) via **video** recording
4. System processes video, extracts audio, and stores voice pattern
5. Video is stored on disk (local dev) or S3 (production) for rare verification needs
6. Confirmation of successful enrollment

### Document Signing with Voice
1. User receives document for signing
2. User reviews document and clicks to sign
3. Signature dialog opens with voice option
4. User selects voice signature method
5. System prompts for recording with instructions
6. User records signature phrase (**audio only**, no video needed)
7. System processes recording and confirms validity against enrollment
8. Voice signature is applied to document
9. Signing is completed

### Voice Signature Verification
1. Document receiver opens signed document
2. Voice signature indicators are visible on document
3. Receiver can click to verify voice signature
4. System plays back recording and shows transcript
5. Verification status is displayed
