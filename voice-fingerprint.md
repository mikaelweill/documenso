# Voice Fingerprinting Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the basic implementation plan for adding voice fingerprinting and verification to Documenso. The feature will allow users to enroll their voice during signup by uploading a video, extracting the audio, and then comparing subsequent voice signatures against this enrolled voice profile to verify the signer's identity.

## Implementation Progress

### Current Status (Updated)

As of the latest update, we have made significant progress on the voice fingerprinting feature:

✅ **Implemented Database Schema**: Created the VoiceEnrollment model in schema.prisma with profileData field  
✅ **Created Video Recording Component**: Implemented video-recorder.tsx for capturing enrollment videos  
✅ **Set Up S3 Storage**: Configured AWS S3 for secure storage of voice enrollment media  
✅ **Implemented Audio Extraction**: Added server-side processing to extract audio from enrollment videos  
✅ **Created Voice Enrollment API**: Built route handlers for voice enrollment submission  
✅ **Added Voice Enrollment to Signup**: Integrated voice enrollment step in the signup flow  
✅ **Implemented Media Display Component**: Created voice-enrollment-display.tsx for playback  
✅ **Added Presigned URL Support**: Implemented secure media access via presigned S3 URLs  
✅ **Improved Media Playback**: Added robust error handling and playback UI with progress tracking  
✅ **Voice API Integration**: Implemented Azure Speaker Recognition API for voice verification  
✅ **Voice Profile Service**: Created service for enrolling and verifying voice profiles  
✅ **Verification API Endpoint**: Added /api/voice-verification endpoint for verifying voices  
✅ **Verification UI Components**: Created VoiceVerification and VerificationResult components  
✅ **Verification Flow**: Implemented verification during document signing  
⬜ **Verification Analytics**: Pending implementation of verification tracking and analytics

## Voice Verification API

We're now using the Microsoft Azure Speaker Recognition API for voice biometric verification:

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **API Type** | Text-independent speaker verification |
| **Provider** | Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services |
| **Enrollment** | 20+ seconds of audio for initial profile creation |
| **Verification** | 4+ seconds audio sample compared to enrolled profile |
| **Security** | Scores from 0.0-1.0 with configurable threshold (default 0.5) |
| **Pricing** | Free tier: 5,000 transactions/month |
| **Language** | Language-independent (works with any language) |

### How It Works

1. **Enrollment** creates a voice profile in Azure:
   - User records voice during signup
   - Audio is extracted and sent to Azure
   - Profile ID and data stored in database

2. **Verification** compares a voice sample to the enrolled profile:
   - User records short audio sample during signing
   - Sample sent to Azure with profileId
   - API returns confidence score (0.0-1.0)
   - Verification success determined by threshold

### API Response Format

```json
{
  "verified": true,
  "score": 0.85,
  "threshold": 0.5,
  "details": {
    "result": "Accept"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Components

  id                String    @id @default(cuid())
  userId            Int
  createdAt         DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt         DateTime  @updatedAt
  videoUrl          String?   // URL to stored enrollment video
  audioUrl          String?   // URL to extracted audio
  videoDuration     Float?    // Duration of the video in seconds
  profileData       Json?     // Store API-specific voice profile data
  isActive          Boolean   @default(true)
  isProcessed       Boolean   @default(false)
